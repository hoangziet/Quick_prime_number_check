# Methods check whether a number is prime or not

I did some exercises related to prime number in some pages like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces,... and get TLE ERROR

So that I learned and make this 4 methods in order to optimized my code and make it run faster than ever.

1.Loop from 2 to n/2 : O(N/2)

2.Loop from 2 to sqrt(n) : O(sqrt(N))

3.Fermat primality test : O(K.logN) 

4.Miller-Rabin : O(K.log3N)

Furthermore, I make a Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the prime numbers that smaller than the number N : O(N.logN)
